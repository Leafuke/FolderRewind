v1.4.0 has been released. To avoid any unexpected issues, it is recommended to use the `Data Migration` feature in the settings to back up your configurations and history before updating.

If you want to use the linkage module feature, please make sure that the linkage module version is 1.0.0+, the MineRewind plugin version is 1.4.0+, and you have downloaded the KnotLink server.
