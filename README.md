## Introduction

FolderRewind is a modern, powerful, and user-friendly backup manager built with **WinUI 3** and **.NET 10**. It allows you to protect your important data—documents, project files, or game saves—by creating automated, versioned backups with ease.

As the spiritual successor to MineBackup, FolderRewind enhances its versatility while retaining extensibility for users with diverse needs. Featuring a powerful built-in plugin system, it allows plugin developers to optimize for specific scenarios such as **Minecraft game saves**, making it an ideal choice for gamers and advanced users.

## Features

- **🛡️ Reliable Backups**: Uses the **7-Zip** engine for high-performance compression and encryption.

  - **Interval-based** backups (e.g., every 30 minutes).
  - **Scheduled** daily tasks using a 24-hour clock.
  - **On Startup** events to capture changes as soon as you log in.
- **🔌 Plugin System**: 
  - **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically scans and configures backups for known folder structures (e.g., Minecraft saves).
  - **Hot Backups**: Plugins can intervene to create snapshots before backing up locked files.
- **⏳ History Timeline**: View a clear timeline of your backups. "Rewind" your folder to any previous state.
- **🎨 Modern Design**:
